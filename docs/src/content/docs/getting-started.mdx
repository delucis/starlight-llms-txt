---

`starlight-llms-txt` is a plugin for the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) documentation website framework that auto-generates `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` context files for large language models based on your documentation site’s content.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

<Steps>

1. `starlight-llms-txt` is a Starlight [plugin](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/). Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-llms-txt" />

2. Configure the plugin in your Starlight [configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) in the `astro.config.mjs` file.

   ```diff lang="js"
   // astro.config.mjs
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   +import starlightLlmsTxt from 'starlight-llms-txt'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
         title: 'My Docs',
   +      plugins: [starlightLlmsTxt()],
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server):

   <PackageManagers type="run" args="dev" />

4. Visit [`localhost:4321/llms.txt`](http://localhost:4321/llms.txt) to preview the plugin in action.

</Steps>

## Next steps

See the [Configuration](/configuration/) guide to learn how to adjust the output of the plugin.
