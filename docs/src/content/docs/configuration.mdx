description: How to customize the llms.txt and llms-full.txt files generated by the starlight-llms-txt plugin
---

The `starlight-llms-txt` plugin can be configured in your Astro config file:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" {11-13}
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import starlightLlmsTxt from 'starlight-llms-txt';

export default defineConfig({
	site: 'https://example.com/',
	integrations: [
		starlight({
			title: 'My Docs',
			plugins: [
				starlightLlmsTxt({
					projectName: 'Very Cool Tool',
				}),
			],
		}),
	],
});
```

## Options

The following configuration options are available to pass to the plugin:

### `projectName`

**Type:** `string`  
**Default:** the value of Starlight’s `title` option

Provide a custom name for this project or software.
This will be used in `llms.txt` to identify what the documentation is for.

For example, with `projectName: "FastHTML"`, the generated `llms.txt` file would start:

```md title="llms.txt" "FastHTML"
# FastHTML

## Documentation Sets

- [Complete documentation](https://example.com/llms-full.txt): the full documentation for FastHTML
```

### `description`

**Type:** `string`  
**Default:** the value of Starlight’s `description` option

Set a custom description for your documentation site to share with large language models.
Can include Markdown syntax.
Will be displayed as a blockquote in `llms.txt` immediately after the file’s title.

According to [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) this should be:

> a short summary of the project, containing key information necessary for understanding the rest of the file

### `details`

**Type:** `string`  
**Default:** `undefined`

Provide additional details to add after the `description` in `llms.txt`.

According to [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) this should be:

> Zero or more markdown sections (e.g. paragraphs, lists, etc) of any type except headings, containing more detailed information about the project and how to interpret the provided files
